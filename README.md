# Virtual Machine for TinyOS with Vagrant and Ansible

Setup a virtual machine to build [TinyOS] firmware for wireless sensor motes in no time.

- Runs with [VirtualBox], [Vagrant] and [Ansible] but do not fear. Even if you don't know these in depth â€“ I've got you covered.
- Based on a [Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS][ubuntu-server] base box from the [bento project].


## Installation

It's easy as 1, 2, 3.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:wedi/tinyos-virtual-machine.git
cd tinyos-virtual-machine
vagrant up --provider virtualbox
```

Go and get a  :coffee: or a  :beer: during the first run. It will take some time to to downloaded and install all the software.  
:tada: You are having a VM, readily provisoned with everything you need to build TinyOS firmware.

Hit `vagrant ssh` to login.


## Configuration

TODO... _(you know what that stands for... :grin:)_

- Have a look into the [Vagrantfile]. Most likely you want to adjust the shared folder.
- You will find more options in [provisioning/vars/main.yml][vars/main.yml].


## Requirements

You need to install [VirtualBox] and [Vagrant]. That's it.


## Limitation

Right now only the MSP430 microcontroller (e.g. used on TelosB motes) is supported because that's the only one I am using. Feel free to [open an issue][issue-mcu] on my related Ansible project if you need support for a different one.


## License

This code is released under the terms of the [MIT license].


## Honorable Mentions

- Adam Brett's [Quickstart Guide to Vagrant & Ansible] gave me a head start.
- Thanks to the authors of the Ansible roles I am reusing
    - Jan Vlnas: [unattended-upgrades role]
    - sunscrapers: [python role]
    - Ryan Yates: [timezone role]
- The maintainers of VirtualBox, Vagrant and Ansible for believing in Open Source.
